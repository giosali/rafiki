</p>

> __Note__
>
> Holding down the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key will add decimal separators to the result to improve readability.

### Web Searches

Never experience the hassle of having to open your web browser *and* open a new tab just to look something up again. With Rafiki, you can quickly open websites or make web searches with ease.

Rafiki comes outfitted with several handy web queries that you can use out of the box. You can always disable the ones you don't want to see in your search results.

**Wish there were more**? Create your own web queries by going to `Settings` **→** `Features` **→** `Your Web Searches`.

### URLs

Got a URL on hand? Paste it into Rafiki and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open it in your default web browser.

### Trash

Type `empty trash` into Rafiki's search box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

### QoL

#### Transparent Window

When the search window is open, you can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to make the window semi-transparent. This can be extremely useful for viewing content obscured by the window. You can toggle off the effect by either pressing the keyboard combination again or by closing the window.

#### Default Results

While typing or pasting something into the search window, your input might inadvertently match a keyword when you simply want the default search results to appear. No worries. You can force the default search results to appear by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>.

### Alternative Results

Many search results have the option of displaying additional information or providing additional functionality when holding down the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key. This functionality can also be leveraged when creating your own web searches.
